# Tic Tac Toe AI
This project implements a Tic Tac Toe game with an AI opponent, built as part of Harvard's **CS50 AI** course. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to play optimally.

## Features
- Play against a perfect AI opponent.
- Implements the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
- Interactive command-line interface.

## Learning Highlights
- Learned about the Minimax algorithm for decision-making in games.
- Explored concepts of recursion and optimal strategy in AI development.
